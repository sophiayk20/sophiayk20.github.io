Hi, I am a final year undergraduate student at Yale University studying computer science. <br/>
I have always been interested in studying foreign languages and (perhaps for this reason!) am interested in <b>Language AI</b> (language processing and speech synthesis in artificial intelligence). I currently speak 3 languages - <i>English, Korean and Spanish</i>, but my longer term goal is to learn more languages.<br/>
At Yale, I am involved in computer science education initiatives such as being a TA for Data Structures and Programming Techniques. <br/>
While I spend most of my time studying quantitative fields at school, in my free time, you can find me at art museums or studying foreign languages! I can be reached through the email I have included below.
