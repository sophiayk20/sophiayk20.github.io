Hi, I am a final year undergraduate student at Yale University studying computer science. I have always been interested in studying foreign languages and (perhaps for this reason!) am interested in language processing and speech synthesis in artificial intelligence. At Yale, I am involved in computer science education initiatives such as being a TA for Data Structures and Programming Techniques. While I spend most of my time studying quantitative fields at school, in my free time, you can find me at art museums or studying foreign languages! I can be reached through the email I have included below.
