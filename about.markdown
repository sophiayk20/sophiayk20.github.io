Hi, I am a final year undergraduate student at Yale University studying computer science. <br/>

I have always been interested in studying foreign languages and (perhaps for this reason!) am interested in <b>Language AI</b> (language processing and speech synthesis in artificial intelligence). My longer term goals as of now is two-fold: (1) to learn more about artificial intelligence and (2) to learn more languages (I currently speak <b>English, Korean, and Spanish</b>, but I hope to become fluent in more!).<br/>

At Yale, I am and have been involved in <b>computer science education initiatives</b> such as being a TA for Data Structures and Programming Techniques and being a part of Code Haven (teaches New Haven middle school students how to code).<br/>

While I spend most of my time studying quantitative fields at school, in my free time, you can find me at art museums or studying foreign languages. I can be reached through the email I have included below.

안녕하세요, 한국에서 용인외대부고를 우수졸업하고 현재 미국 예일대학교 컴퓨터과학과 4학년 재학 중입니다. 외국어와 AI 공부하는 것을 좋아해 Language AI Research에 관심이 많습니다!
