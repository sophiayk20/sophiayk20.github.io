I am an undergraduate student at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/) double majoring in computer science and economics (expected May 2025). My research interests lie in speech processing and natural language processing, as well as multimodal translation. In industry, I worked as an AI research engineer intern at the text-to-speech (TTS) teams at [NAVER Cloud](https://www.navercloudcorp.com/) for natural language processing and [Samsung Electronics](https://www.samsung-dxrecruit.com/dept/detail/C0003) for acoustic processing in Seongnam and Suwon, South Korea. In academia, I worked as a research intern in the natural language processing department of [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research/department/natural-language-processing-department/) in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

I currently speak 3 languages - English, Korean, and Spanish - but hope to become a more multilingual polyglot in the future!
