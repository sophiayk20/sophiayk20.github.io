        <p>
        I am an undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.yale.edu">Yale University</a> double majoring in computer science and economics (expected May 2025). My broad research interests lie in <b>speech processing and natural language processing</b>, as well as <b>multimodal translation</b>. In industry, I worked as an AI research engineer intern at the text-to-speech (TTS) teams at <a href="https://www.navercloudcorp.com/">NAVER Cloud</a> for natural language processing and <a href="https://www.samsung-dxrecruit.com/dept/detail/C0003">Samsung Electronics</a> for acoustic processing in Seongnam and Suwon, South Korea. In academia, I worked as a research intern in Professor Alham Fikri Aji's lab at the natural language processing department of <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research/department/natural-language-processing-department/">MBZUAI</a> in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.<br/>

        I currently speak 3 languages - English, Korean, and Spanish - but hope to become a more multilingual polyglot in the future! (Studying French has always been a long time wish of mine..)  
        I enjoy learning languages because it opens me up to different cultures and perspectives.

## News
- **[7/9/2024]**: My first paper is accepted to the **Student Research Workshop** at **ACL main conference 2024**. I was also offered a travel grant for attending ACL. Beyond excited to be in Bangkok, Thailand!

- **[6/26/2024]**: My team and I at MBZUAI UGRIP received the best team award from Professor Timothy Baldwin, provost of MBZUAI. We ranked first out of 9 ML/CV/NLP teams for research content for our project on multilingual, multitask statement tuning of encoder models.

- **[6/6/2024]**: I was accepted to **Interspeech YFRSW 2024**. I am offered a scholarship to attend and present my speech processing research at Interspeech 2024 in Kos, Greece. 

## Publications

#### 2024

- **CoVoSwitch: Machine Translation of Synthetic Code-Switched Text Based on Intonation Units**  
  Yeeun Kang.  
  *Proceedings of the 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Student Research Workshop, 2024*

## Projects
- **Multilingual, Multitask Statement Tuning for Encoder Models**   
  <small>May 2024 - Jun 2024 (@MBZUAI)</small>     
  Created multilingual NLU datasets and made them available through HuggingFace. Evaluated zero-shot performance of encoder models on various downstream NLU tasks.   
  HuggingFace organization repo: [link](https://huggingface.co/mbzuai-ugrip-statement-tuning)     
  Topics: `encoder models`, `statement tuning`, `NLU`

- **Evaluating Translation Models for Code-Switching Text created by PSST based on Whisper**   
  <small>Apr 2024 - Jun 2024 (Independent Project)</small>   
  Work accepted at ACL-SRW 2024.    
  Detected intonation unit boundaries of utterances in CoVoST 2 (speech-to-text translation dataset) with PSST, a pre-trained speech segmentation model from Whisper (STT), to create code-switched text leveraging prosodic features. Evaluated current SOTA NMT models' performance on 13 languages, including low-resource languages such as Welsh, Mongolian, and Tamil.       
  Topics: `prosodic speech segmentation`, `speech recognition (STT)`, `neural machine translation (NMT)`, `code-switching`

- **Undisclosed Project using LLMs**  
  <small>Jan 2024 - Apr 2024 (@NAVER Cloud)</small>   
  Intern project at NAVER Cloud.    
  Paper TBD.  

- **Fine-tuning Whisper for Speech Recognition and Transcription**  
  <small>Aug 2023 - Dec 2023 (@Yale University)</small>     
  Course final project for Yale's `CPSC 488/588: AI Foundation Models`. Took course with MS, PhD students and received full marks.    
  Project README and Code: [link](https://github.com/sophiayk20/whisper-asr)

- **Refining Custom Voice Metric**  
  <small>Jun 2023 - Aug 2023 (@Samsung Electronics)</small>       
  Intern project at Samsung Electronics.    
  Blog post: [link](http://sophiayk20.github.io/2023/08/17/an-exploration-into-tts/)    
  Topics: `speech synthesis (TTS)`, `mean opinion score (MOS)`, `custom voice on Bixby`





## Teaching
I was involved in different computer science education initiatives as an undergrad at Yale.
- CPSC 223: Data Structures and Programming Techniques (C, C++) [Spring 2023, Fall 2023]
- CS50: Introduction to Computing and Programming (C, Python, SQL, JavaScript) [Fall 2022]

- Code Haven [Sep. 2021 - May 2022]
  - Taught middle school students in New Haven how to code in Scratch. Here's the link to the organization:
