        I'm a recent graduate of Yale University with a B.S. degree in computer science and economics with an interest in speech processing and natural language processing. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to present my research in speech and NLP at Interspeech 2024 (Kos, Greece) and ACL 2024 (Bangkok, Thailand), supported by named grants and conference scholarships. I also worked as in the industry text-to-speech teams of NAVER and Samsung Electronics in South Korea. Outside of work, I enjoy studying foreign languages (I'm finally starting my fourth language in 2025!!) and exploring historic sites. I‚Äôm interested in themes of memorialization and selective preservation/destruction of material cultural heritage.

        <p>
        Post-graduation from Yale, I'll begin full-time work at Amazon as a Software Development Engineer in New York City.

  <h3>Code-Switched Text Dataset Creation by Intonation Unit Detection and Replacement</h3>
  <small>Apr 2024 - Jun 2024 (Independent Project)</small>
  <p>Work accepted at ACL-SRW 2024. Detected intonation unit boundaries of utterances in CoVoST 2 (speech-to-text translation dataset) with PSST, a pre-trained speech segmentation model from Whisper (STT), to create code-switched text leveraging prosodic features. Evaluated current SOTA NMT models' performance on 13 languages, including low-resource languages such as Welsh, Mongolian, and Tamil. I named my synthetic dataset CoVoSwitch.</p>

## Teaching
I was involved in different computer science education initiatives as an undergrad at Yale.

I was a TA (Teaching Assistant) for the following courses:
- **CPSC 223: Data Structures and Programming Techniques** (C, C++) [Jan 2023 - Dec 2023]
- **CS50: Introduction to Computing and Programming** (C, Python, SQL, JavaScript) [Aug 2022 - Dec 2023]

and a mentor for:
- **Code Haven** [Sep. 2021 - May 2022]
  - Taught middle school students in New Haven, Connecticut how to code in Scratch. 


## Other Fun Things
I participated in **HackMIT 2022**. Along with 3 other team members I met on the site (2 others from the US and 1 from Canada), we were awarded as finalists at the hackathon held in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 

I was also at the **CS50 Hackathon** at Harvard in Fall 2022, where I pulled an all-nighter(!!) helping Harvard and Yale students with their creative projects.

#### Random Fact
My favorite course at Yale was HSAR 247: Art and Myth in Greek Antiquity (Fall 2022), where I wrote a course final paper on the Parthenon as a palimpsest. This course met in the Yale University Art Gallery and motivated me to visit the Acropolis Museum in Athens in 2024 and the British Museum in London in 2025.
