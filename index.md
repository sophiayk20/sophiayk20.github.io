        <p>
        I'm a recent graduate of Yale University with a B.S. degree in computer science and economics with an interest in speech processing and natural language processing. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to present my research in speech and NLP at Interspeech 2024 (Kos, Greece) and ACL 2024 (Bangkok, Thailand), supported by named grants and conference scholarships. Outside of work, I enjoy studying foreign languages (I'm finally starting my fourth language in 2025!!) and exploring historic sites. Iâ€™m also interested in themes of memorialization and selective preservation/destruction of material cultural heritage.

## Selected Projects
- **Multilingual, Multitask Statement Tuning for Encoder Models**   
  <small>May 2024 - Jun 2024 (@MBZUAI)</small>     
  Created multilingual NLU datasets and made them available through HuggingFace. Evaluated zero-shot performance of encoder models on various NLU tasks. Published, ACL 2025 Findings.
  Topics: `encoder models`, `statement tuning`, `NLU`   
  [[HuggingFace Org Repo]](https://huggingface.co/mbzuai-ugrip-statement-tuning)
  , [[Final Presentation Slides]](), and [[Blog Post]]()       

- **Code-Switched Text Dataset Creation by Intonation Unit Detection and Replacement**   
  <small>Apr 2024 - Jun 2024 (Independent Project)</small>   
  Work accepted at ACL-SRW 2024.    
  Detected intonation unit boundaries of utterances in CoVoST 2 (speech-to-text translation dataset) with PSST, a pre-trained speech segmentation model from Whisper (STT), to create code-switched text leveraging prosodic features. Evaluated current SOTA NMT models' performance on 13 languages, including low-resource languages such as Welsh, Mongolian, and Tamil. I named my synthetic dataset CoVoSwitch.          
  Topics: `prosodic speech segmentation`, `speech recognition (STT)`, `neural machine translation (NMT)`, `code-switching`

## Teaching
I was involved in different computer science education initiatives as an undergrad at Yale.

I was a TA (Teaching Assistant) for the following courses:
- **CPSC 223: Data Structures and Programming Techniques** (C, C++) [Jan 2023 - Dec 2023]
- **CS50: Introduction to Computing and Programming** (C, Python, SQL, JavaScript) [Aug 2022 - Dec 2023]

and a mentor for:
- **Code Haven** [Sep. 2021 - May 2022]
  - Taught middle school students in New Haven, Connecticut how to code in Scratch. 


## Other Fun Things
I participated in **HackMIT 2022**. Along with 3 other team members I met on the site (2 others from the US and 1 from Canada), we were awarded as finalists at the hackathon held in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 

I was also at the **CS50 Hackathon** at Harvard in Fall 2022, where I pulled an all-nighter(!!) helping Harvard and Yale students with their creative projects.

#### Random Fact
Random fact: my favorite course at Yale was HSAR 247: Art and Myth in Greek Antiquity (Fall 2022), where I wrote a course final paper on the Parthenon as a palimpsest. This course met in the Yale University Art Gallery, and motivated me to visit the Acropolis Museum in Athens in 2024 and the British Museum in London in 2025.
